# MEGPNM (reset)

This repository has been intentionally reset to a clean slate. All previous history and files have been removed so the project can be rewritten from scratch.

- Current state: empty placeholder.
- Next steps (for future contributors): add new source files, documentation, and assets as needed.

> Note: keep your local backups if you still need the previous code or datasets—the GitHub remote will now only contain fresh commits going forward.
